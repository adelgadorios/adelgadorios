# Hello there! 👋

My name is Alejandro Delgado, and I'm a Computer Science Ph.D. student at the University of South Florida. 

My research is in **Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)**, focusing on understanding and improving how people interact with emerging technologies like **Augmented Reality**. I lead end-to-end user research to discover, invent, and build more intuitive and effective mixed-reality experiences.

<br/>

## 🔭 What I'm Working On

-   **AI for Clinical Assessment:** Developing a multimodal AI system using Computer Vision and NLP to infer communicative intent from the speech and gestures of individuals with aphasia.
-   **AR Interaction Models:** Conducting user studies with both children and adults to build foundational conceptual models of how users expect to interact with virtual objects in AR headsets.
-   **Virtual Agents in AR:** Researching how children perceive and collaborate with virtual agents across different educational contexts in AR headset applications.
